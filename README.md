### This is a simulation of a COVID-19 like virus epidemic within the United States, where you have 180 days to _"play god"_ and help mitigate the spread.

At times like this where the rest of our senior year is cancelled, we really wish there were things that played out differently so that our senior year is **not** cancelled.
So, we made this game to _actually_ do things differently.

### Click on any state to start the original outbreak; use the upgrades to save the people.
_Our challenge to you is to **finish the game before day 180**! Can you do it?_

_**check the chart at the end to see how you did!**_
